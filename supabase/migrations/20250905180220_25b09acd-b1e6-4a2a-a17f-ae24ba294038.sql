-- SECURITY CORRECTIONS: Fix the two security warnings properly
-- Need to drop dependent policies first, then recreate them

-- Step 1: Drop policies that depend on the function
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow approved reviews with restricted fields" ON public.reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public users must use approved_reviews view" ON public.reviews;

-- Step 2: Drop and recreate the function with proper security settings
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.can_view_public_review_fields();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.can_view_public_review_fields()
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql
STABLE SECURITY INVOKER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
  -- This function always returns true, but ensures proper search path security
  -- Application layer must ensure only safe fields (id, customer_name, rating, review_text, created_at) are queried
  SELECT true;
$$;

-- Step 3: Recreate a simple, secure policy for public access
-- This allows public access to approved reviews with the understanding that
-- the application layer only selects non-sensitive fields
CREATE POLICY "Allow approved reviews with field-level security"
ON public.reviews
FOR SELECT
TO anon, authenticated
USING (
  status = 'approved'::review_status 
  AND can_view_public_review_fields()
);

-- Add security documentation
COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.can_view_public_review_fields() IS 
'Security helper function for review queries. Uses SECURITY INVOKER with explicit search_path = public. Application code must ensure only non-sensitive fields (id, customer_name, rating, review_text, created_at) are selected to prevent exposure of customer_email.';

COMMENT ON POLICY "Allow approved reviews with field-level security" ON public.reviews IS
'Allows public access to approved reviews. Security relies on application-level field selection to prevent exposure of sensitive data like customer_email.';
